Welcome to the **Assignment Hackathon** repository! This project was developed as part of a hackathon challenge.


**Purpose:**

This repository houses a Python-based project developed for a hackathon assignment.

**Structure:**

*   **`main.py`:** The primary Python script, serving as the application's entry point.
*   **`Assignment_abc.json`:** A JSON file containing configuration data or input parameters used by the application.
*   **`abc.jpg`:** An image file, potentially used for image processing or as a resource within the application.
*   **`requirements.txt`:** Lists the Python dependencies required to run the application.
*   **`.env`:** (Optional) An environment file to store environment variables for configuration purposes.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Cloning:**
    *   Clone the repository using:
        ```bash
        git clone [https://github.com/Abhinay2007/Assignment_hackthon.git](https://github.com/Abhinay2007/Assignment_hackthon.git)
        ```
2.  **Navigation:**
    *   Navigate to the project directory:
        ```bash
        cd Assignment_hackthon
        ```
3.  **Virtual Environment (Optional):**
    *   Create a virtual environment for isolated dependencies:
        ```bash
        python -m venv env
        source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
        ```
4.  **Installation:**
    *   Install required dependencies:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
5.  **Usage:**
    *   Run the application using:
        ```bash
        python main.py
        ```

**Git Tagging Conventions:**

*   **Releases:**
    *   Use tags like `v1.0`, `v1.2.3` to mark official releases.
*   **Milestones:**
    *   Tag significant milestones with labels like `alpha`, `beta`, `final`.
*   **Features:**
    *   Tag completed features with descriptive names like `feature_login`, `feature_user_profiles`.
*   **Bug Fixes:**
    *   Tag bug fixes with labels like `bugfix_issue123`, `bugfix_security_vulnerability`.

**Example Tagging:**

```bash
# Tagging a release
git tag -a v1.0 -m "Initial stable release" 

# Tagging a feature
git tag -a feature_user_profiles -m "Added user profile functionality"
